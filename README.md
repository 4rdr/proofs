# proofs

This repository primarily houses my collection of old and occasional new findings related to CVEs and their references. Around 99% of these discoveries stem from personal endeavors outside of my professional commitments, though there may be occasional overlap.

Whenever I come across vulnerabilities in newer software or relatively recent releases, I strive to inform the respective project owners.  Many times I get no response after multiple emails.

In cases where the software is several years old or has reached its end-of-life stage, I make it a point to verify newer versions before sharing my findings. For software versions that are considerably aged or belong to end-of-life software, I simply document and store them here without further action.
