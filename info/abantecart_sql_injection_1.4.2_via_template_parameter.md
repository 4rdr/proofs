AbanteCart 1.4.2â€™s extension/generic endpoint is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL injection via its URI parameter, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary queries. Three techniques have been demonstrated: error-based injection using a crafted FLOOR-based payload, time-based blind injection via SLEEP(), and UNION-based injection to extract arbitrary data. An attacker can exploit this flaw without any credentials to read or manipulate the database and even cause denial-of-service delays. Automation tools like sqlmap can fully exploit the vulnerability with high risk and confidence levels. Patching to a fixed version or enforcing parameterized queries and strict input validation will mitigate the issue

This is a unique case where cookies are wanted to be set.  This is the best command to use
 python3 ~/tools/sqlmapproject-sqlmap-c8c7fee/sqlmap.py -r ./sql.txt --level 5 --risk 3 --force-ssl --dbms mysql --answers='you have not declared cookie=n,Do you want to follow?=y' --flush
